# form-validation
Form validation uses Jquery validation plugin and Tooltip.
I had an error that says "you have called tooltip show method for uninitialized component."
The reason was I forgot to initialize for input[type='number'] components.
It took 1 hour to fix this small error.
Oh, my gosh!!!

I want you to take less time than me!
